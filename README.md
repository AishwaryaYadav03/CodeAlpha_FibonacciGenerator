#Fibonacci Generator   

This code creates a sequence of Fibonacci numbers. Here's how it works:

1)It defines a function called fibonacci_series that calculates Fibonacci numbers up to a specified count.


2)Inside the function, it starts with the first two Fibonacci numbers [0, 1] and then adds the last two numbers to generate the next number in the sequence.


3)It repeats this process until it reaches the specified count of Fibonacci numbers.


4)After generating the sequence, it prints out the Fibonacci series.

Additionally, it includes a mechanism to handle user input:
1)It asks the user to input the number of Fibonacci numbers they want.
2)If the input is not a valid integer or if it's not a positive number, it prompts the user to enter a valid input.
3)Once the user provides a valid input, it generates and displays the Fibonacci series accordingly.
